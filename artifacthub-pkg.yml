  ## Kubescape Headlamp plugin

  The Kubescape Headlamp plugin provides an open source plugin for Headlamp.

  [Kubescape](https://kubescape.io/docs/operator/) is a security platform protecting against configuration issues and image vulnerabilities.
  [Headlamp](https://kubescape.io/) is a dashboard for Kubernetes, and is extensible with plugins. 

  The Kubescape Headlamp plugin provides views in Headlamp for configuration and vulnerabilities scanning, based on information delivered by the Kubescape operator.

  ## Prerequisites

  - [Kubescape operator](https://kubescape.io/docs/operator/) should be installed in the k8s cluster and enabled for configuration and image scanning.
    We recommend Kubescape operator helm chart v1.22.0 or later with `capabilities.continuousScan: enable`.

    If the operator is working, custom resources are generated. You can test this with e.g. `kubectl get workloadconfigurationscans -A`.

  - [Headlamp](https://github.com/headlamp-k8s/headlamp) should be installed in the k8s cluster or workstation. For a quick test the desktop version is recommended.

  The plugin has been tested with Headlamp v0.25.0 (browser and desktop) and kubescape operator helm chart v1.22.0.

  ## Installation 

  Desktop Headlamp 
  - Install Headlamp (https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/installation/desktop/)
  - Open Plugin Catalog 
  - Select the KubeScape Headlamp plugin and click the install button
  - After install you may need to restart Headlamp 

  In-cluster Headlamp 
  - Install Headlamp (https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/installation/in-cluster/)
  - The installation files can be found on the release page in github. Here you can download the tarball. Add an initContainer to the headlamp install to download the plugin files. See [example helm values](https://github.com/Kubebeam/kubescape-headlamp-plugin/blob/main/examples/headlamp-helm-values.yaml).
  - Alternatively follow the guidance from headlamp to create a container image with the plugin artifacts: https://headlamp.dev/blog/2022/10/20/best-practices-for-deploying-headlamp-with-plugins/.

  ## Use cases

  For an overview of compliance in a cluster:

  - View controls
  - View resources
  - View namespaces

  For an overview of vulnerabilty scanning in a cluster:

  - View CVEs
  - View workloads
  - View images
  - View SBOM

  For inspecting namespaces or deployments: 

  - View a namespace, see a summary of configuration issues and vulnerabilities
  - View a resource (e.g. Deployment), see a summary of configuration issues

  Multitenant clusters are supported with help of [allowed namespaces](https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/faq/#i-cannot-access-any-section-in-my-cluster-it-keeps-saying-access-denied) cluster setting.
