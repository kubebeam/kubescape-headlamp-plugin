  ## Kubescape Headlamp plugin

  The Kubescape Headlamp plugin provides an open source plugin for Headlamp.

  [Kubescape](https://kubescape.io/docs/operator/) is a security platform protecting against configuration issues and image vulnerabilities.
  [Headlamp](https://kubescape.io/) is a dashboard for Kubernetes, and is extensible with plugins. 

  The Kubescape Headlamp plugin provides views in Headlamp for configuration and vulnerabilities scanning, based on information delivered by the Kubescape operator.

  ## Prerequisites

  - [Kubescape operator](https://kubescape.io/docs/operator/) should be installed in the k8s cluster and enabled for configuration and image scanning.
    We recommend Kubescape operator helm chart v1.22.0 or later with `capabilities.continuousScan: enable`.

    If the operator is working, custom resources are generated. You can test this with e.g. `kubectl get workloadconfigurationscans -A`.

  - [Headlamp](https://github.com/headlamp-k8s/headlamp) should be installed in the k8s cluster or workstation. For a quick test the desktop version is recommended.

  The plugin has been tested with Headlamp v0.25.0 (browser and desktop) and kubescape operator helm chart v1.22.0.

  ## Installation 

  Desktop Headlamp 
  - Install Headlamp (https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/installation/desktop/)
  - Configure Settings/Plugins/Plugin Catalog and make sure "Display only Official Plugins" is unchecked. 
  - Open Plugin Catalog 
  - Select the KubeScape Headlamp plugin and click the install button
  - After install you may need to restart Headlamp 

  In-cluster Headlamp 
  - Install Headlamp (https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/installation/in-cluster/)
  - The installation files can be found on the release page in github. Here you can download the tarball. Add an initContainer to the headlamp install to download the plugin files. See [example helm values](https://github.com/Kubebeam/kubescape-headlamp-plugin/blob/main/examples/headlamp-helm-values.yaml).
  - Alternatively follow the guidance from headlamp to create a container image with the plugin artifacts: https://headlamp.dev/blog/2022/10/20/best-practices-for-deploying-headlamp-with-plugins/.

  ## Functionality

  - Compliancy overview page with views on controls, resources and namespaces.
  - Vulnerabilities overview with views on CVEs, resources and images.
  - Generated Network policies viewer.
  - Playground for Validation Admission Policies.
  - eBPF-based runtime threat detection

  The queries to the Kubescape database use Headlamps feature for `Allowed namespaces`, supporting multi tenant clusters. Configuration of this setting is done per user in Settings/Cluster.
